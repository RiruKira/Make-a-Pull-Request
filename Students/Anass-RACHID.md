# Anass RACHID

## Whoami:

I'm an EMSI, Morocco student, I'm arab. I like to code, red, write, sing, produce music.

I work on HTML & CSS the most, and sometimes C. I'm still not knowing what I'm going to do from now to the future but I will be always in programming/coding thing.
I like to check open-source files, explain them, develop them.

I like to be with good people, nice people. And I'm a little bit shy sometimes, but when it comes to coding I'm serious LOL!
I love watching Anime, Design on Photoshop and produce my own music.


## Languages that I know:

- HTML
- CSS
- C/C++
